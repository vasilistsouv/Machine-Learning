# Big data project

This repository comprises a Python script (finance_data_extraction.py) for extracting finance data, along with instructions for setting up an Azure environment, including an Azure Databricks workspace, a storage account, and a container for efficient data organization. Access between Databricks and the storage container is secured using access keys. Additionally, a Databricks cluster is created to enhance processing efficiency. The extracted data is then analyzed using Python and apache spark, highlighting the importance of Spark in data analysis with its speed, ease of use, versatility, scalability, and support for end-to-end data pipelines. Leveraging the power of Spark in Azure Databricks facilitates collaborative and scalable data science and engineering. Refer to the instructions for step-by-step guidance on running the Python script, configuring Azure, Databricks, storage, and conducting data analysis.
